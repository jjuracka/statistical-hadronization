# statistical-hadronization

This repository contains the code and documentation for my project titled "Statistical Hadronization Model" for the VPJRS course at FNSPE, CTU in Prague. It uses a theoretically derived formula and experimentally obtained parameters for central LHC collisions to calculate expected mid-rapidity particle yields and compares the results to observations.
